The DS1307 serial real-time clock (RTC) is a low-power, full binary-coded decimal (BCD)
clock/calendar plus 56 bytes of NV SRAM. Address and data are transferred serially through
an I2C™, bidirectional bus. The clock/calendar provides seconds, minutes, hours, day, date,
month, and year information. The end of the month date is automatically adjusted for months
with fewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap year. The clock operates in either the 24-
hour or 12-hour format with AM/PM indicator. The DS1307 has a built-in power-sense circuit
that detects power failures and automatically switches to the battery supply.
